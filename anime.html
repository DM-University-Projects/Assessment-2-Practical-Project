        <h3>Attack On Titans</h3>
        <p>Call of Duty’s return to World War II is surprisingly a fast-paced take on the classic setting. It provides for a good campaign,
          a great new mode in multiplayer among other good changes, and a creepier, dense version of Nazi Zombies. However, each core part
          of Call of Duty: WW2 is marred by inconsistencies and minor flaws that hold it back from being a landmark in the series. Still,
          it’s a solid Call of Duty game and I’ve enjoyed the many hours I’ve already poured into it.</p>

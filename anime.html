          There was an insurmountable gap in power between them and mankind, and as a result, humanity was rapidly exterminated to the brink of extinction.</p>

      The leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn, Naruto Uzumaki. Orphaned by the
      attack, Naruto was shunned by the villagers, who out of fear and anger, viewed him as the Nine-Tails itself. Though the Third Hokage outlawed
       speaking about anything related to the Nine-Tails, the children — taking their cues from their parents — inherited the same animosity towards
       Naruto. </p>

       and anyone can count themselves dead if they so much as make eye contact—or so the rumors say. In actuality, Vash is a huge softie who claims to have

            Edward and Alphonse Elric only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one forbidden act of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward
            loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor.
            Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called
            "automail" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.</p>

       by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone
       harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying
       out the Inspectors' dirty work.</p>

       for. Maybe... there is even a little hope for some romance in her future.</p>

#Introduction About The Website

    This is an Anime Blog Website, where people come to view content about  anime, images, videos, and also gaming. They can also come to see what chottoitsanime top rated animes are within a filter list.. .

# Motivation to creating an Anime Social Website

   The Motivation of creating this website is due to my Youtube Channel Called ChootiItsAnime, The website
   contain reviews, rants and any thing related to anime. This website will also be linked to my Youtube channel
   so that later I can use this website for any business rated ventures that is linked to what I do on YouTube.
   When I say linked I mean some of my YouTube content will be shown on the website for the users to watch and
   comment on.

# Implications That I Faced

  Tried in incorporate a open close navigation - I would say this was the most trouble for me. Easy to understand
  task but for some reason it would not work for me. Maybe it was clashing with some css code but I will try to
  sort it out at a later date. 02/12/2017 - 1:39pm

  Had many Issues implicating a open and close Nav bar. Used YouTube videos for help but still was a big difficult.
  After search the internet I found one that somewhat worked. 02/12/2017 - 4:46pm

  One problem that I can say annoyed me was implementing a arrow image within the boxes I wanted to filter
  for some reason the arrow would never show, I researched and spend time trying to implement this and to no result. -21/12/2-17

  I've realised that web development isn't has easy has I made it out to be, I've had implications where I couldn't find the proper CSS code for background Images
  some how while watching a Youtube video on javascript I saw an example and tried it. Worked. Other than that I still haven't found
  a proper way to use onlick within the js file. Still searching for a proper method.

  Another Problem that I'm facing is that my js code wont work out side the html. I've had this error before where I place a window.onload = function(){ at the top.
  This had corrected it and it worked. But for some reason today it isn't working. So again I will have to find out how I can get this to work from the js file and not the html.

# Harvard Referencing (HR8 Problems)

    This mute button gave me some trouble. If you notice from the link, the code and whats in the actually website is similar but different,
    I had to mess around with different type of codes to get an understand of the overall js and how it works. With the help of youtube and
    many different web developing sites. This was possible.

# Harvard Referencing (HR9 Adapting)

    With the hamburger menu and many other implementations I had to research different codes, watch different Youtube videos to gain
    and understanding so that I could change the code it self. Some where quiet easy and understandable, change something, see what it
    does and implement on that visual knowledge. Majority of this website was created by using that method to learn and understand.

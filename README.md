#Introduction About The Website

    This is an Anime Blog Website, where people come to view content about about anime, images, videos,
    and top rated animes. .

# Motivation to creating an Anime Social Website

   The Motivation of creating this website is due to my Youtube Channel Called ChootiItsAnime, The website
   contain reviews, rants and any thing related to anime. This website will also be linked to my Youtube channel
   so that later I can use this website for any business rated ventures that is linked to what I do on youtube.
   When I say linked I mean some of my youtube content will be shown on the website for the users to watch and
   comment on.

# Implications That I Faced

  Tried in incorporate a open close navigation - I would say this was the most trouble for me. Easy to understand
  task but for some reason it would not work for me. Maybe it was clashing with some css code but I will try to
  sort it out at a later date. 02/12/2017 - 1:39pm

  Had many Issues implicating a open and close Nav bar. Used YouTube videos for help but still was a big difficult.
  After search the internet I found one that somewhat worked. 02/12/2017 - 4:46pm

  One problem that I can say annoyed me was implementing a arrow image within the boxes I wanted to filter
  for some reason the arrow would never show, I researched and spend time trying to implement this and to no result. -21/12/2-17
